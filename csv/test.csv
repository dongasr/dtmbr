1,Backcasting,backcasting,Backcasting,Working backwards to implement a preferred future,"Backcasting invites us to start strategic conversations from a speculative future, by identifying the key differences between that future and today.",Clare Cooper,
2,Body Mapping,body-mapping,BodyMapping,Find out how your users feel by drawing the body inside out,"A body map is composed of a simple outline of a human figure. After experiencing an interaction or situation, participants are invited to visually document their bodily experience by drawing and writing on the silhouette.",Claudia Núñez-Pacheco,
3,Context Mapping,context-mapping,ContextMapping,Harnessing creativity to reveal hidden needs,"Context mapping belongs to the family of generative research techniques in which participants make artefacts that represent their experiences and talk about these, which enables them to reflect more deeply on their lives.",Angineh Karabedian,
4,Design Team Cards,design-team-cards,DesignTeamCards,Building a strong design team by recognising and valuing attributes,"The design team cards method helps team members reflect on their own attributes, using a set of predefined ‘roles’ to identify how they might best contribute.",Stationery Hoe,https://unsplash.com/photos/NO1MXvxy02o
5,Design Timescapes,design-timescapes,DesignTimescapes,Making the precedents and consequences of our designs visible,"Design timescapes visualise historical and future influences in an organised way, allowing us to better understand how design concepts, products and projects came into being and what the consequences of their realisation are for broader society.",Clare Cooper,
6,Empathy Mapping,empathy-mapping,EmpathyMapping,Making visible the invisible to better understand your user and their experiences,Empathy mapping is a visual method that can support the understanding and interpretation of previously collected data by directly representing the experience of an individual person.,Josh Calabrese,https://unsplash.com/photos/qmnpqDwla_E
7,Impact Ripple Canvas,impact-ripple-canvas,ImpactRippleCanvas,"If we don’t plan the world we want, we have to live with the one we get",The impact ripple canvas helps us extrapolate the consequences of a design decision outwards so we can visualise a network of secondary and tertiary actions that might spawn from the – usually well thought out – primary consequences.,Mike Lewinski,https://unsplash.com/photos/hh7UrZGZAF8
8,Local Orbits,local-orbits,LocalOrbits,Cultivating the art of observing a place,"The local orbits method encourages acknowledgement of the challenges and opportunities specific to the locale within which we are designing, by cultivating our sensory perceptions of a place.",chuttersnap,https://unsplash.com/photos/u2VPMFRrhGU
9,Material Exploration,material-exploration,MaterialExploration,Engaging with physical materials to find new ways of doing things,Material exploration prompts designers to select and consciously explore materials and to draw on that exploration for ways that the material could be used in a design solution.,Callum Hill,https://unsplash.com/photos/L7V4rwETDb0
10,Morphological Charts,morphological-charts,MorphologicalCharts,"Breaking a big, messy problem into bite-sized pieces","Morphological charts offer a structured way of breaking a big problem down into manageable parts and tackling these one at a time, with the aim of finding the optimum solution.","Double-M, Public Domain Dedication (CC0)",https://www.flickr.com/photos/double-m2/4705739444
11,Non-human Personas,non-human-personas,Non-humanPersonas,Giving a voice to living things and ecosystems,"Non-human personas address some limitations of human-centred design methods, by adapting the personas method to give non-human stakeholders a voice in the design process.","Maria Aiolova, Terreform",
12,Pop-ups,pop-ups,Pop-ups,Encouraging people to interact with temporary installations in public spaces,"Pop-up installations provide an engaging way of collecting data from people in public spaces by employing a variety of formats, such as ‘pop-up’ events that are located in high pedestrian thoroughfares.","Li Ozinga, China Studies Centre, The University of Sydney",
13,Scenario-based Thinking,scenario-based-thinking,Scenario-basedThinking,Why settle for one future when you can explore four?,"Scenario-based thinking allows us to generate four possible future scenarios based on local and global drivers, to understand their impact on the success or failure of the products or services we design.",Clare Cooper,
14,Speculating Preferred Futures,speculating-preferred-futures,SpeculatingPreferredFutures,Using dystopian and utopian narratives to explore a problem area,"Speculating preferred futures encourages the consideration, development and communication of new realities and new possibilities, with the aim to lead to new ideas and a deeper understanding of the problem area.",Clare Cooper,
15,STEP Cards,step-cards,STEPCards,Turning a web of external factors into actionable insights,The STEP card method can be used individually or as a group during the early stage of a project as a visual way of capturing external factors.,,
16,Strategy Choice Cascade,strategy-choice-cascade,StrategyChoiceCascade,Improving a strategy with five key questions,"The strategy choice cascade uses a collaborative way of thinking about the driving questions in strategy development, using a non-sequential pathway based on five key questions.",Ian Schneider,https://unsplash.com/photos/TamMbr4okv4
17,Systems Mapping,systems-mapping,SystemsMapping,Visually identifying the components of complex systems,"Systems maps support systems thinking, which is an approach to understanding how the individual components within a network influence each other. They can be represented in various ways, most of which focus on identifying causal relationships.",John Barkiple,https://unsplash.com/@barkiple
18,Values Cartouche,values-cartouche,ValuesCartouche,Visualising values to inform design decisions,Our values are fundamental to who we are and guide many of our day-to-day decisions.

19,Wireflows,wireflows,Wireflows,Visualising the relationships between wireframes,"Wireflow diagrams are a quick way to visualise how individual screen designs ‘connect’ to each other. The wireflow method uses elements from wireframes and flowcharts, bringing both of these communication tools together.",UX Indonesia,https://unsplash.com/photos/qC2n6RQU4Vw
