        <p>Welcome to the companion website for <strong>Design. Think. Make. Break. Repeat.</strong><br> – a handbook that documents sixty methods used in design innovation projects leading to the design of new products or services. This website features a short description of each method along with free printable design templates and resources used in the exercises featured in the book. Enjoy! </p>
        <p>This book has a companion MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/innovation-through-design">available on Coursera</a>. The 5-week course demonstrates some of the methods from the book and how they can be used in practice. It brings the design process of think-make-break-repeat to live through case studies and interviews with some of Australia’s leading design firms, Atlassian, Design+Industry and Wunderman Bienalto. The course is suitable for anyone who is curious about design and translating the processes and tools of design thinking into innovative opportunities.</p>

                <p>This book documents sixty methods along with tools and case studies that involve multiple design disciplines and perspectives – from product and service design to interaction and user experience design. It is written as a learning resource and reference guide to scaffold the reader’s understanding of the design process as a method for complex problem-solving and innovation.<br>
                Each method is presented through an evidence-based description along with step-by-step exercises and ready-to-use templates. The methods are applicable to a variety of design projects and across a range of domains and industries. This cross-disciplinary approach is also reflected in the choice of design challenges and case studies included in the book, which ranges from autonomous vehicles to designing the future shopping experience.<br>
                The methods included in the book have been contributed by leading experts in the field hosting many years of experience in design research and practice. The exercises and templates are informed by the learnings from fifteen years of teaching courses on design in the <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/architecture/research/design-lab/">Design Lab</a> at the University of Sydney.</p>
