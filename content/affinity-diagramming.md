User research methods such as interviews can lead to large amounts of data, which makes it difficult to gain insights just by looking through the data, e.g. listening to audio recordings or reading through transcripts. Affinity diagramming is a simple and cost effective systematic method for processing such data, which is typically qualitative in nature. It allows for analysing data (breaking down of data into parts) as well as synthesis (forming a coherent whole out of parts).
