Card sorting is a method that allows users and stakeholders to participate in the design of an information architecture. As its name suggests, card sorting involves participants sorting and organising cards into groups that are meaningful to them. In giving participants tangible cards, this method can provoke discussion and action that can help: 1) discover what information or tasks should be included or excluded in a design, 2) discover what terminology users know this by (e.g. _News_ or _Current Affairs_), 3) design new ways for this grouping and structuring of information in a product or service.
