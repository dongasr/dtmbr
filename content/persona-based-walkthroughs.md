If personas (p.100) are characters that allow us to represent users, persona-based walkthroughs are the stage and story through which they are brought to life. A persona-based walkthrough gives these characters something to do. We enact a persona and _walk_ through specific tasks or scenarios, seeing the designs through their eyes. Thus, we become the minicab driver using their navigation app, the commuter on a bus playing a game on their iPhone, a pilot using specialist tools or software. We can evaluate designs from the perspective of those who will ultimately end up using them.
