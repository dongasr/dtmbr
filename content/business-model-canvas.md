Several studies show that business model changes are among the most sustainable forms of innovation. For example, a company like Uber would not have been able to disrupt the taxi industry just by having a great user interface for their mobile app. Although their mobile app was an innovative product in itself, it is their business model that led to their global success. When designing new products or services, it is therefore important to also consider the design of the underlying business model. Just like products and services need to be iteratively developed and tested, good business models also need to go through the stages of conceptual development, exploration and implementation.
