Contextual observation can be used to study people's behaviour in different environments, such as workplaces, homes, public spaces, and so on. Experiences in real life don't happen in a vacuum, and contextual observation takes into account the range of external factors that can influence people's behaviour, such as environmental, temporal and social factors.
