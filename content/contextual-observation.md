Contextual observation can be used to study people_s behaviour in different environments, such as workplaces, homes, public spaces, and so on. Experiences in real life don_t happen in a vacuum, and contextual observation takes into account the range of external factors that can infl uence people_s behaviour, such as environmental, temporal and social factors.
