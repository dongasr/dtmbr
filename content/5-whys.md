The 5 whys method helps to uncover a potential root cause to any surface level problem. The method provides a structured approach for repeatedly asking _why_ in order to provide deeper insight into the given problem. Originally developed by the Toyota Motor Corporation, this iterative method was first deployed for manufacturing root-causeanalysis issues. Despite its engineering foundations, 5 whys is a popular design method used to draw out assumptions to problems on the surface and to gain a deep level of understanding of a problem situation. The aim of continual questioning is to ensure that the right problem is examined and made central to the design process.
