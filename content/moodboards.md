Mood boards are used to visually represent design ideas, concepts and values in an open-ended and evocative way. There are no specifi c formulas for designing mood boards. However, they should be crafted to foster discussion and to facilitate the generation of ideas. The fi nal outcome looks similar to a collage, comprising images from magazines, photographs and other visual elements such as coloured paper, textures, fabrics, and any other object that could be easily attached to a blank surface or board. It is also possible to create digital mood boards, which may include video snippets, website captures, various images, and so on.
