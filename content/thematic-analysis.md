Thematic analysis focuses on establishing themes. Themes are defi ned as short words or phrases that assign _a summative, salient, essence-capturing and/or evocative attribute_ (Salda¤a, 2009, p.3) to a portion of written or visual data. For example, interviewees may repeatedly express their opinion on the price, cost or value of a certain product; though each interviewee may use different words, phrases or tones of voice, all of these expressions could be grouped under a single theme _cost sensitivity_. The theme may relate to other data _ for example, we might choose to catalogue high or lowcost sensitivity, relate it to other themes, such as _quality_, _lifestyle_ or _income_. Thematic analysis can be used for bottomup as well as top-down interpretation of data. Following a bottom-up approach, the themes emerge from engaging with the data. When using a top-down approach, the themes are predetermined, for example, based on a research question or hypothesis that act as starting point for the analysis.
