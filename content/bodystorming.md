Bodystorming is a form of brainstorming, with an emphasis on generating ideas and unexpected insights through physical exploration, experience and interaction. While brainstorming is typically done with pen and paper sitting down, bodystorming requires active physical participation and experience of situations. Using your whole body to act out situations enables you to draw on how you sense and feel the world, not just how you think about it.
