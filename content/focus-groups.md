As its name suggests, a focus group involves a group of people having a focused discussion on a specifi c topic. Like interviews (p.78), focus groups elicit understandings through asking questions and prompting conversations. While interviews typically focus on just the interviewer and the interviewee, a focus group allows for fi ndings to emerge from the social dynamic of a group discussion. Focus groups allow designers to gather information across many phases of the design process. They are most useful for gathering concrete information about existing experiences, building empathy or understanding with users, defi ning the design problem, and providing feedback on design concepts and prototypes.
