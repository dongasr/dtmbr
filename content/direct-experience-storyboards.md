Direct experience storyboards is a method that combines the advantages of systematic observation, direct experience, documentation and storytelling. The method is useful for the contextually sensitive situations where it may not be possible or convenient to conduct direct user research such as hospitals, libraries, museums, and other public and private institutions with similar characteristics. By acting out a given scenario in an authentic setting, designers can capture both positive and negative aspects of a user_s experience, and collect impressions of what it is like to interact with a product or service.
