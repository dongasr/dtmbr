Mockups are scale or full-size models of products and their features. They have been used widely in the industrial design and manufacturing process to visualise the detailed representation of an envisioned product early on in a design process. They are also useful for testing ideas and getting buy-in from external stakeholders before spending time on building functional prototypes.
