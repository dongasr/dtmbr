Perceptual maps are graphical representations of how people subjectively perceive products or consumer brands available in the market. Products or brands are positioned or mapped according to attributes that are relevant for customers, such as quality or price. The nature of attributes is determined by the specific market that is being catered for. For instance, attributes such as comfort and safety might be fundamental for products relating to transport, whereas battery life, storage capacity and portability are likely more relevant for digital consumer products. Attributes can also refer to values that products or brands represent. These attributes are expressed as opposite adjectives such as _family friendly_ versus _adult_, _simple_ versus _sophisticated_, and so on
