When working in teams, it can be challenging to reach consensus about what should be prioritised in the design process. Having consensus is essential to allow teams to manage resources effectively by focusing on the most important issues or ideas. The KJ Brainstorming method provides a structured approach for identifying these top priorities. Named after its inventor Japanese anthropologist Jiro Kawakita, the KJ method provides a process for organising and prioritising a large number of data items that need to be addressed in a design solution - represented either in the form of issues or ideas.
