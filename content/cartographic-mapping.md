Mapping and other methods involving making collages are frequently employed in participatory design workshops to capture and understand domain-specific user knowledge. Cartographic mapping is a mapping method with a particular focus on the mediating role of the mapmaking activity in mutual knowledge construction. In this method, the facilitator and participant are working together on creating a visualisation of the participant_s daily routines, relationships and settings within a problem domain.
