Science fiction prototypes are stories placed in the distant future. They allow the fictional exploration of scenarios, in which people interact with envisioned products or services. The narrative of the story is based on real scientific principles and technologies but explores their use in an environment that is free of constraints. The story follows a set structure, which includes identifying the characters, the scientific principle or technology, and so on. Critically, the narrative should include an inflection point, possibly leading to a disaster, as well as an exploration of the implications and how the characters can recover or overcome this disaster.
