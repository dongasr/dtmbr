Wireframes are line drawings that show the fundamental structure or functions of a product or system. As an extension of sketching (p.116), wireframes offer a formal way for designers to think and communicate what a design can do, without surplus high-fidelity information such as images, fonts, colours or typography, that may distract from the core purpose. Because wireframes do not look or act like a finished product, they are quick to produce and invite modification.
