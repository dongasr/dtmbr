Service blueprinting plots out all the individual elements in order to form a picture of the overall system. This helps to make it more comprehensible, and identify strengths and weaknesses. The service blueprint resembles a fl owchart in which the horizontal dimension shows progress through time, and connections between steps are represented by arrows. A line in the middle of the page called the _line of visibility_ helps to indicate what is apparent to the user and what is hidden. Everything above the line is _on-stage_ and everything below the line is _backstage_.
