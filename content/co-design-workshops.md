Co-design workshops bring users, customers, stakeholders and designers together to rapidly critique and iterate on design concepts, ensuring that the needs of the people we are designing for remain at the centre of the design process. Codesign and similar methodologies, such as participatory design, involve the users and other stakeholders participating actively, building on concepts they are presented with (be it a current user experience or a new design concept) and informing the future direction of the design. The principle of co-design is to _design with_ rather than _designing for_ people. Users and other stakeholders are in an active role, contributing to the design, rather than passively responding to design decisions.
