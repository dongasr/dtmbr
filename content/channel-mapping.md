Channel mapping is a method that goes beyond listing the ways customers are contacted by a company to explore what a company_s brand value means to a particular customer. Companies engage with their customers through a range of channels. Every interaction that people have with companies involves some form of a channel. Channels can be digital (e.g. websites) or physical (e.g. stores). They represent routes of communication between an organisation and its customers, which includes completing commercial transactions. In particular, online purchases are one of the most rapidly growing forms of shopping, with sales growth rates outperforming buying through traditional retail channels.
