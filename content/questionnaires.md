Questionnaires collect information in written form and may be communicated by paper or digitally. They are a low-cost way for collecting large amounts of data without requiring trained facilitators or lab equipment. Questionnaires are commonly used during early user research and for collecting feedback about people's current experiences with existing products or services. A consent form can be included in the questionnaire to obtain permission for collecting data from respondents.
