The group passing technique _ also referred to as brainsketching technique _ is a form of brainstorming that engages a team of people in collaboratively producing new ideas, solutions or design concepts. By working together, the team can draw on each other_s creative inputs. The technique seeks new perspectives on each idea from all members of the team, encouraging them to contribute to an idea while avoiding criticism or negative feedback.
