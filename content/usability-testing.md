Usability testing allows us to determine whether people understand how to use a product, in other words, whether the conceptual model of the product matches the user_s mental model. More specifi cally, usability refers to ef ciency, effectiveness and satisfaction (Nielsen, 1994). Usability testing should measure all three aspects. For example, ef ciency can be measured by recording the time it takes for a user to complete a certain task. Effectiveness can be measured by recording whether people were able to complete a task. Satisfaction can be measured through recording quotes from your participant, either while they are interacting with the product using the think-aloud protocol (p.124) or in a post-test interview or questionnaire (p.102).
