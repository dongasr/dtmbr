Video prototyping is a useful method to communicate an idea before building functional prototypes. A video prototype is a short movie showing how one or more users would interact with a future product based on a scenario (Markopoulos, 2016), allowing to quickly record concepts in an engaging visually rich format. Using videos is benefi cial for (1) providing the context of use, (2) communicating a narrative around experiencing a product or service, and (3) showing interactions between people and their environment including facial expressions and body gestures.
