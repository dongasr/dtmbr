The role-playing method is used to evaluate an existing design or a design concept represented as a prototype. It is based on role-playing in theatre, where actors take on one the role of a particular character and subsequently act out scenes. In a design context, the actors can be members of the design team, the extended project team, prospective users, other stakeholders, or even trained theatre actors. They are asked to step into the shoes of a character and to act out scenes from that character_s point of view, which involve interactions with the existing design or prototype.
