When designing products or services, we try to come up with many ideas and explore the envisioned product or service from many perspectives. The same approach can be brought to designing business models, which are the backbone of any company that offers products or services. Business models need to be customer-centred, as they describe what values the products or services bring to the customer of a company. However, the customers are not always the users of the products or services. For example, in a social networking site such as Facebook, the users enjoy the service and the customers generate value by paying for advertising. The business model needs to be designed to consider both.
