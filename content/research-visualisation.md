Research visualisations capture the most relevant results of a research process and display them in a prominent and visual manner. Often they take the form of a large-format poster that can be hung on the wall and used as a point of reference. They create sustained engagement within the design team and ensure that the research lives on throughout the design process. The objective of research visualisations is to transfer the inspirational qualities of the original research, an understanding of the main issues, and empathy with the target audience.
