Scenarios _ also referred to as future scenarios or user stories _ use storytelling to explore design ideas by grounding them in a real context. They connect design ideas to the people who will use the product or service. Their focus, therefore, is on the relationship between people and the designed product or service, their objectives, the context, and potential social implications.
