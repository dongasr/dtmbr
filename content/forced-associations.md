When using forced association for idea generation, we combine disparate concepts and try to come up with ideas based around them. The forced association exercise starts with a list of objects or themes that are related to the problem or brief that you are working on. This list could be a set of relevant keywords such as user goals, possible activities, types of target users, or potential technologies that could help solve the problem or brief.
