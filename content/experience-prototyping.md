Prototypes typically explore the tangible qualities of a design solution. However, they can also be used to test and explore the intangible qualities of a design. The experience prototyping method enables a focus on the user experience and context of use, rather than fixating on the product form and features. It highlights the experiential dimensions - how people think, feel and act in situations of use with future products and services. Experience prototyping is commonly used when the physical, social, spatial and temporal dimensions of a situation are important to explore.
