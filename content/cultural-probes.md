The cultural probes method supports divergent thinking. It relies on playful and provocative tasks mediated by wellcrafted items. First introduced by Gaver and his colleagues (Gaver, Dunne and Pacenti, 1999), cultural probes are physical packets consisting of various items such as maps, disposable cameras, and postcards. The items come with openended and provocative tasks for acquiring inspirational responses from a community of participants about their lives, thoughts and values. In its approach, the cultural probes method draws on situationist art practices such as psychogeography and d‚rive. It values uncertainty, play, exploration, and subjective interpretation as ways of dealing with the limits of normative scientifi c approaches to knowing.
